# My shell setup

I'm super excited to share with you my awesome shell setup that makes my coding life so much easier and fun! 😍

All you need to do is clone this repo and run appropriate script. It will install everything you need in a snap (excluding terminal and nerd font).

## Windows

Run windows.bat as admin.

## Linux

```bash
sudo bash ./linux.sh
```

## Mac

Warning: This script isn't tested! I don't have a mac.

```bash
sudo bash ./mac.sh
```

If that didn't work probably script.ps1 didn't run properly. Start a powershell session and copy the contents of script.ps1 and paste it. I will fix it ASAP!

You need to use one of these terminals: [Supported Terminals](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode#terminal-compatibility-list) You also need to use a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). Trust me, you will love the icons and glyphs. 😎 Remember to set the nerd font and powershell as your default shell in your terminal.
