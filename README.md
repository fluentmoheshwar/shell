# My shell setup

I'm super excited to share with you my awesome shell setup that makes my coding life so much easier and fun! 😍

All you need to do is clone this repo and run windows.bat as an administrator. It will install everything you need in a snap. I'm working on a Mac and Linux script too. 🙌

You need to use one of these terminals: Windows Terminal/Hyper/iTerm/gnome-terminal (others might work too). They are all amazing and customizable. You also need to use a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). Trust me, you will love the icons and glyphs. 😎 Remember to set the nerd font and powershell as your default shell in your terminal.
