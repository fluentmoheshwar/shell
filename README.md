# My shell setup

I'm super excited to share with you my awesome shell setup that makes my coding life so much easier and fun! 😍

All you have to do is clone this repo and run windows.bat as admin. It will install everything you need in a snap. Mac and Linux script coming soon. 🙌

You need to use Windows Terminal or Hyper as terminal. They are both amazing and customizable. You also need to use a nerd font. Trust me, you will love the icons and glyphs. 😎
